## Gender Bias in English-to-Portuguese Translation
This repository contains the data and code used in my master's thesis "**Diving into Gender Translation Bias for the Portuguese Language** - A Comparative Analysis of Commercial Machine Translation Systems, General-Purpose LLMs, and Non-Commercial Translation-Specific Models". 

### Contents:
* Original WinoMT dataset, adapted to include Portuguese (with additional experiments and metrics)
* New extensions of the dataset:
  - inter-2: Two-sentence context
  - inter-3: Three-sentence context
* Fine-tuned model: configuration, scripts, and fine-tuning dataset 

### Acknowledgments
This work was inspired by and builds on datasets and methods from:
* [Evaluating Gender Bias in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00591) (Stanovsky et al., 2019)
* [Reducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation Problem](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.690/) (Saunders and Byrne, 2020)
